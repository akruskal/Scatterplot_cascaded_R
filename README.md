# Chapter 3 assessment task

Your task is to create a simple report as an Rmarkdown document using _knitr_
that includes some _ggplot_ output.

The skeleton has been created for you.

You will be looking at the `ChickWeight` dataset from the _datasets_ package,
drawing some plots and answering a couple of questions.

Fill out the skeleton _chapter-3-assessment.Rmd_ in the assessment project,
commit your changes and push back to _GitHub._

Feel free to store the plot in a variable and build it up gradually
rather than repeat all the code each time.
See the code in the tutorial worked example.
